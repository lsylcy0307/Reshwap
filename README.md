# Reshwap

## Do you not know what to do with clothes you don't wear anymore? What about the million-dollar textbooks that you kept in the corner of your room? Or, on the contrary, are you looking for something at a good deal? Worry no more!

Reshwap is the un"official" student-created and student-organized trading website of Lawrenceville School. Log in with your Lawrenceville email account and start posting your books, furniture, clothing, and other items on Reshwap.

When you create a post about an item, anyone in the school will be able to see the details of your post and contact you. You can then meet up with them in person in order to make the trade. The website itself is not directly involved in the trade and it does not charge any commissions.

## For Sustainability on Campus

The Lawrenceville community generates 30 tons of trash per month on average. Reshwap is a great way of cutting down on our landfill contributions. Reducing waste takes less energy and resources, and is preferable to recycling.
